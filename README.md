# Multi-Class Detection of AI-Generated Phishing Using Stylometric Features and Transformer 

To get the joblib, safetensors, and config files, vist the [Multi-Class Detection of AI-Generated Phishing Using Stylometric Features and Transformer model](https://www.kaggle.com/models/mujibulhaque/ai-phising-artifacts) as there is upload size limit (change to the updated version).

## 🔁 Reproducibility Statement

All trained models, feature extractors, out-of-fold predictions, calibrated probability matrices, and evaluation artifacts are provided to ensure **full reproducibility** of the experimental results reported in the paper.

Researchers can reconstruct ensemble predictions or conduct further analyses using the provided artifacts without retraining models.
