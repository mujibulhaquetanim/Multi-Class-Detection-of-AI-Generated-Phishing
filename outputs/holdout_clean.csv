"" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims . but now a bona fide wolf has arrived , whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state  * and nobody will believe it . true , california would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated . and even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market , prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators . but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn ' t workable competition in california ' s power market , and that the actions of generators "" gaming the system "" have greatly magnified the crisis . the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand . a rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently  * and very profitably  * short of supply even during periods of low demand , when there ought to be lots of excess capacity . as frank wolak , the stanford economist who also advises the state ' s power grid , has pointed out , an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick . you can ' t tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons , but you can look for circumstantial evidence . and such evidence has convinced mr . wolak that "" generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market ""  * a view shared by a growing number of other researchers . which brings us to the latest move by the federal energy regulatory commission . on wednesday , the commission apparently decided to offer california some relief , and put new price caps in place on the california electricity market . i say "" apparently "" because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all . indeed , the measure was passed on a 2 - to - 1 vote , with william massey  * the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls  * voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual . what ' s wrong with ferc ' s plan ? first , it caps prices only in emergency conditions  * ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no emergency . in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive , in spite of all the evidence that it is not . second , even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes , offering extensive opportunities for what mr . wolak calls "" megawatt laundering ""  * selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls ( for example , the controls do not apply to "" imports "" from neighboring states ) , then selling it back into the california market . severin borenstein of the university of california energy institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant , generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently : "" i predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again , and they will be pretty inefficient . "" the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan . there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there  * indeed , last fall mr . wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts  * but ferc has ignored all of them . the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn ' t get it , that it just can ' t bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real . the uncharitable interpretation is that last week ' s action was meant to fail . the medley report , an online newsletter , calls the ferc plan "" a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to deflect any political fallout "" from the looming disaster . whatever the explanation , the plain fact is that ferc and the administration have yet to offer california any significant relief . 00 fo 04 b 3 blabf visit nytimes . com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the web , updated throughout the day . become a member today ! it ' s free ! http : / / www . nytimes . com ? eta how to advertise - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - for information on advertising in e - mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with the new york times on the web , please contact alyson racer at alyson @ nytimes . com or visit our online media kit at http : / / www . nytimes . com / adinfo for general information about nytimes . com , write to help @ nytimes . com . copyright 2001 the new york times company",,,,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",1

"california update 07 . 22 . 01 summary of the activities since friday : overall , it ' s 50 - 50 or better that the legislature will finish up the budget and recess until august 20 th , without having passed some form of an "" edison mou . "" will have a better view of the chances of getting an mou agreed to and passed through both houses by cob monday . in the senate : the "" edison mou "" : as previously reported , on friday , sb 78 - - - the senate ' s version of the edison mou - - passed out of the full senate and was sent to the full senate . the bill sticks 100 % of suppliers ' debts with edison ' s shareholders but pays qfs and other creditors . the authors believe that suppliers can ' t force edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the px , not edison , which in their view means that the suppliers can ' t reach edison . our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective . the bill creates an option to buy the transmission system , but rejects the goernor ' s mou , which buys it outright . though there ' s some uncertainty , the bill appears to end direct access . information we have indicates that the assembly does not support and will not pass sb 78 in its current form . enron ( and the marjority of market participants ) opposes 78 . the "" dunn investigation "" : dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against enron on saturday . the report recommends that the senate fine us , beginning with $ 1 , 000 the first day , and doubling everyday thereafter until enron "" complies . "" dunn announced on saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full senate for a vote on saturday . in response , our lobbyist in sacramento spoke to a leader of the republican party in the senate ( ross johnson ) , and persuaded johson to negotiate the date of the vote with burton and dunn . she was successful - - - johnson went to burton and got him and dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the senate returned from its recess on august 20 th . if the senate returns early , it could vote prior to the 20 th , but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time . the budget : the senate passed the budget at about 1 am sunday morning . the senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until august 20 th . that leaves the assembly alone in sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the edison mou . the assembly in short , leadership within the assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party - - the democrats . the speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue . unable to do a deal , the assembly recessed saturday night and has not reconvened . it has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget . the assembly also has not passed its version of an edison mou , which it says it intends to do . best information we have right now is that the assembly does not plan to go back into session until tuesday morning . late saturday night , the assembly speaker released yet another version of his edison mou ( ab 82 xx ) , but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among assembly democrats to pass it . enron - - together with business customers - - opposes the version of 82 xx released on saturday night because it does not adequately ensure direct access . best , jeff",,,,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",1

"re : seeking opportunity in computational finance dear vince : thanks for your response . i am not a programmer , nor a "" quant "" . i am an expert in excel and otherwise have advanced skills in the remaining msoffice suite . beyond that i have extensive experience working with research and computer progamming personnel on projects from networks to databases , and in particular , automation . for instance , the first generation of the risk analytics system that i designed for quantlab was done in excel . in subsequent generations of the system , excel served only as the gui - given its extreme flexibility - and a sql database operated underneath ( compaq servers , raid array ) , integrating real - time operations for all components of the system . the research team at quantlab used many leading edge modelling methodologies , such as genetic algorithms , neural networks , principal component analysis , kernel density estimation , fast kernel regression , hidden markov modelling and many other pattern recognition , walk - forward back testing , and other simulation techniques . i was the sole individual on a team of 17 that had any practical trading experience , and therefore , felt that i played a critical role in the application and implementation of each of the system components from data mining to research to signal generation to execution . beyond that , i was uniquely qualified to articulate the project ' s mission to investors , and therefore , was highly successful in spearheading support - financial and otherwise - from our network . althought i did not ask specifically , i surmise from your question that you are leading a research effort . i believe that my skill set is best served as a liaison between research and trading , since i speak both languages . i believe that i possess great vision and enthusiasim that could be leveraged in a group , project or product management role to integrate and streamline diverse systems and processes ; a common scenario in most proprietary development settings today . in closing , i would like to learn more about enron and the financial technology effort therein through further discussion with you , or if that is not appropriate , someone to whom you would be comfortable referring me . i look forward to your thoughts . best regards , paul - - - - - original message - - - - - from : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com [ mailto : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com ] sent : tuesday , november 14 , 2000 4 : 30 pm to : epr @ pipeline . com subject : re : seeking opportunity in computational finance paul , can you give me more information about your computer skills ? my group is very hands - on oriented and computer programming is a critical skill . vince "" paul rowady "" on 11 / 14 / 2000 04 : 09 : 43 pm to : "" vince kaminski "" cc : subject : seeking opportunity in computational finance dear vince : in following up on my voicemail message today , i attach my resume below for your review and consideration . it ' s ironic that you called while i was putting the message together . i will keep it short and look forward to speaking to you at your convenience . best regards , paul e . paul rowady , jr . 2300 west alabama , suite 69 houston , texas [PHONE] home / fax [PHONE] mobile epr @ pipeline . com ( see attached file : paul rowady 2 . doc )",,,,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",1

"small cap stox can sizzle the contact center industry few people today know exactly what a contact center does . its predecessor , the call center , brings to mind large telemarketing operations with people calling your house during dinner time . but the fact is that the contact center is much more than that . we see 800 numbers everywhere - the back of our credit cards , the fast food drive - thru window , i ' ll bet even your bottle of water has a phone number to call with questions . the fact is that wherever there is an 800 number , there is a person answering the call . not just a person , but millions of people in north america alone , across a staggering 76 , 000 + contact centers . it used to be the contact center only handled inbound customer service calls and outbound sales calls . that was before the proliferation of the internet - now these same customer service reps are waiting for our phone calls , our faxes , our emails and our web chats . we can call from our offices , home phones , cell phones - even from our computers - americans generate hundreds of millions of transactions each year for contact centers and the industry has grown by leaps and bounds . so aggressive is the growth that today , we are as likely to get someone in california to answer our call as we are to get someone in india . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * contact centers in north america handle millions of transactions each year . for each type of transaction there is a technology that supports it . automatic call distributors for inbound calls , interactive voice response systems ( the dreaded "" press 1 "" ) for self service , email and web servers . in the midst of all of this disparate technology , contact centers began to lose track of a very important piece of their puzzle : information . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the contact center industry is one of the most data intensive industries . think about it - even if you order a pair of shoes , the contact center has your name , phone number , mailing address , billing address , credit card information , etc . the contact center also has information on each and every one of their employees and all of their activity . every call they received , how long they talked , how long they placed people on hold , how many calls were transferred . until now , no single piece of technology can track information on all people regarding all activities , for one simple reason . the activities are all generated and tracked by different technologies . human science systems , inc . ( hmns ) company overview : human science systems , inc . ( pink sheets : hmns ) is a contact center software development firm . its flagship product , central authorityt serves one main purpose : to be a single point of contact for all data generated in the contact center . central authorityt can track and disseminate all data generated in the contact center , regardless of the technology where the data originated . central authorityt is a contact center resource management ( ccrmt ) product . ccrm is the act of managing data regarding all human , physical and technical resources within the contact center . contact center resources can all be categorized under four distinct umbrellas : employees , technology , capacity , and clients . it may be hard to believe , but the reality is that all functions within the contact center fall under one of those four categories , and our company has come up with a method and a technology that allows departments to easily exchange and leverage valuable data on a real - time basis . "" * why hmns should be on your radar : 1 . datamonitor states that the us contact center market reached a volume of 76 , 000 contact centers in 2001 and that by the end of 2006 that number will exceed 79 , 600 contact centers . 2 . contact center reporting and data tracking has always been burdensome , more so with the incorporation of the various technologies required to successfully compete in the industry . 3 . today ' s contact center requires a responsiveness that can only be achieved with timely and accurate insight into business conditions , but this is not easily accomplished in the absence of methods and technology to easily collect data from numerous disparate sources . 4 . contact centers are looking to replace manual or semi - automated methods of data collection and dissemination because they are not only burdensome , but highly inaccurate and complex . 5 . hmns principals have an established track record as industry experts going back over 15 years and have high level contacts in all of the top tier contact centers . top tier contact centers generate over $ 100 million per year within the north american market . 6 . hmns has patentable methods and technologies and recently retained a well known technology patent attorney to process its applications for the protection of its intellectual property . 7 . a recent report by empire research associates stated that the company could achieve rapid market share penetration in the contact center industry market segment and that a 5 % market share level in five years would be plausible . with a mere 5 % market share , a 40 % sales margin ( fully taxed ) would imply $ 10 million of net income in 2010 . in that event , the report noted that on the present 17 . 6 million shares , earnings would exceed $ 0 . 50 per share . the report concluded that "" the target market is large and enticing to hmns and we believe the company ' s product has a good chance of hitting it ! "" 8 . the company is negotiating distributorships through software distributors that currently generate billions of dollars in revenue from the center industry . 9 . hmns will generate revenue not only from software sales , but from application service provider ( asp ) services ( from customers that "" subscribe "" to the technology and access it by the internet ) , from installation ( billable at 12 % of the total software sale ) , and recurring maintenance ( recurring annual revenue billable at 18 % of the value of the software ) . 10 . datamonitor recently estimated the global market for call center component technologies at $ 4 . 1 billion , and predicts an increase to $ 5 . 5 billion by 2007 , growing at a 6 . 0 % compounded annual growth rate . 11 . gartner also reports positive and stable growth for software distributors , stating that end user spending was to exceed $ 76 . 1 billion by the end of 2005 . 12 . last year alone , u . s . banks were forecasted to spend $ 1 . 9 billion on contact center technology . * management and other comments : lou mandic , hmns ceo & president : "" this technology was born out of years worth of research . we are well engrained in this industry and are keenly aware of its needs . we are without a doubt delivering the most mission critical software in the industry today . we anticipate rapid growth , which is not uncommon in our industry . by its fourth year of operation , blue pumpkin - a company that provides only a portion of what central authority offers - had already captured a 7 % market share . a far lesser market share will have our company earning better than $ 10 million annually . "" company philosophy : "" if you can measure it you can manage it . "" * things to consider : according to empire research , the company has a competitively superior product , a large enough market to support sustained rapid growth , and a proprietary market position that can provide handsome profit returns . hmns is in the process of establishing distributorships with companies that annually sell billions of dollars worth of software to contact centers . hmns has buy - out appeal and has already been approached by far larger players that may later be interested in acquiring the company and / or its intellectual property . how the technology works central authorityt is a software product that fills the role of a central repository of data . through meta data tables , the software is able to "" read "" all other technologies , and act as a central point of contact for the enterprise . the software also collects data inherently ( this is data entered directly into central authorityt , not collected from other systems ) on employees , recruiting sources and performance , enabling the organization to better manage its human resource processes and reducing its turnover , which can be as high as 200 % in the contact center industry . * conclusion : the problem with inter - departmental communications is not exclusive to the contact center industry . it is a problem for corporate america as a whole . companies like human science systems are delivering the next mission critical piece of software - one that can normalize all data , across all technologies , and act as a single , central point of contact for the enterprise .",,,,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",2

"broker client louise - - in response to some considerable concern voiced by presto , we are re - evaluating our broker client relationships . i ' m planning to send the following email to each of the desk heads . it is intended primarily to generate feedback from the desks , but my ultimate plan is to shut down the relationships and essentially start over with the desks making the transaction decisions instead of eol . before i launched it , i wanted to get your thoughts . thanks , brad earlier this year , enron executed deals with certain broker ' s which allows the broker to execute transactions for their clients via a broker client which is linked to the enrononline platform . all executions done on broker client are free of brokerage charges . to date , about 80 % of the 3 , 400 broker trades executed on - line have been in the us power segment . the companies that have access to read and execute transactions using the broker client are as follows : apb energy , inc . ( canadian nat gas , canadian power , us nat gas , us power , us coal , us emissions , us weather , us crude , us bandwidth ) natsource llc ( us nat gas , us power , canadian nat gas , us coal , us emissions ) amerex natural gas i , ltd .

"ena sap project as you know , we have substantially wrapped up our work related to this project . today , we are making what i hope are final changes to the maps and deliverables , with the anticipation that we will deliver to you complete binders by wednesday . one issue that we wanted to communicate relates to the use of manual payment processes and the risk that processing manual payments presents in the automated unify / sap environment . this issue was raised by melissa during our discussion of the manual cash reconciliation effort caused by the inability of sap to auto - match cash receipts and disbursements in situations where the money has moved or been received , but the corresponding je has not been made in sap . both melissa and cindy morrow have been involved in subsequent discussions related to the below - mentioned risks . 1 . risk of je and payment duplication : payments taken directly to treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in unify : in the event that the transaction giving rise to the manual payment is entered initially into unify ( which would be the case for all normal commodity payments , excluding broker fee and broker margin payment transactions ) , a risk exists that the payment could be recorded and paid twice ( once by either a / p or treasury when the manual payment is wired and subsequently recorded , and once during the normal unify to sap interface ) . process controls will be put in place to mitigate this risk ; however , all controls will be people - based , not system - based . it is too late to rebuild the unify to sap interface to better address the use of manual payments . one additional suggestion might be to work with each group to reduce the use of manual payments except under well - defined , important circumstances . payments taken to treasury , and underlying transaction is recorded directly to sap ( does not go through unify ) : if the payment is not entered into sap with payment method "" j "" , a / p will not realize that the payment has already been made and will process the disbursement a second time . 2 . risk of understated expense : payments taken to treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in unify : for manual payments that are not finalized in unify ( a process performed in the system to mark an invoice as final ) by month - end ( but the disbursement has already happened ) , expense will be understated . payments taken to treasury , and underlying transaction is recorded directly to sap ( does not go through unify ) : if payment is not input into sap by month - end but cash has moved , expense will be understated . ( cash outflow account will show a credit balance which will be flipped to a / p , but no income statement entry will be made at that time . ) 3 . risk of cash misappropriation : in addition to the above risks related to the use of manual payments , we also believe that a risk exists related to the use of excel - generated counterparty invoices and the lack of segregation between the person responsible for preparing these invoices and also for handling / having access to the related accounting records . we believe that it may be possible for a settlements coordinator to change the bank routing instructions or bank account number on the excel invoice mailed to the counterparty and then manipulate the accounting records during the cash application process to either write off the account balance or to reflect the receivable as being paid while constantly moving cash application balances from one counterparty to another ( so that no one account balance ages past an acceptable range ) . we have been unable to determine a set of control procedures that would mitigate this risk . 4 . revision to counterparty banking details : we are currently investigating the procedure performed by treasury when problems with bank account details cause payments to kick - out of treasury workstation . if the risk of misappropriation exists related to this procedure , we will separately communicate . the above may be unclear . if so , we would be glad to sit down with you for 15 minutes or so and clarify . please let me know if you have any questions . thank you for the opportunity to work on this project .",,,,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",1
"four new graphs we have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the dpr : return on var ( rovar ) curve shift p & l ( delta - gamma ) sharpe ratio risk - return ( large ) risk - return ( small ) all of these graphs deal with the concept of risk - adjusted return . the markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics . furthermore , enron ' s appetite for risk also differs in each market . as a result , it is difficult to compare returns in absolute terms . therefore , the approach of these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk , in effect restating return numbers into a standard base ( how many dollars we earn for every dollar we put at risk ) . for each business unit or commodity group , the rovar graph shows an average of daily total p it shows an average of daily curve shift p & l ( both delta and gamma ) divided by its standard deviation . this sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non - trading p & l ( like new deals , reserves , and so forth ) . furthermore , whereas var is a forward looking statistic ( the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given probability ) , standard deviation is backward looking ( the actual volatility of our returns over the period ) . this graph also has two bars for every business unit or commodity group : a dark brown on the left showing the sharpe ratio on a 4 week rolling basis , and a light brown on the right showing the ratio on a 1 week basis . the curve shift p & l sharpe ratio and the rovar graphs complement each other well . they measure different things , but if our p & l is composed mostly of curve shift , and if our var closely predicts curve shift volatility , the two statistics should be very close . sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the p & l relative to the risk . we therefore put together the risk - return graphs . on the vertical axis , they show 4 week rolling average p & l . on the horizontal , they show 4 week rolling average var . the various business units are plotted as points on the graphs . these graphs are closely related to the 4 - week rovars , in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is the business unit ' s rovar ( average p & l / average var ) . another way of looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin ( 0 , 0 ) with the plotted point of a business unit is its rovar . books with small risks and returns ( < $ 2 million ) are plotted on the "" small "" graph , and the rest , on the "" large "" . these graphs are based on the dpr database that we built to standardize and capture the information that is reported in the dpr . most , but not all of the information in the dpr currently flows from the database . as a result , we do not have rovars or sharpe ratios for every business unit . as we continue to set up exports into the database , we will fill in the missing numbers . we will e - mail you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the intra - net . please remember to launch the file in excel , instead of using the lotus notes viewer . the var limit usage graphs that we created last week are already on the web . we hope that you find all of these useful . regards , eugenio perez",,,,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",1

"attn : utmost assistance from the desk of : mr . chu sengchen , bank of china shenzhen branch , republic of china . dear friend , how are you today and business in your country ? i am mr . chu sengchen , bank manager of bank of china , shenzhen branch , china . i would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail . i contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication . i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . i know you would be wondering why i am writing you with a request such as this but i only urge you to read on . in november 1998 , a british oil consultant / contractor with the chinese solid minerals corporation , mr . robert rice made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit for twelve calendar months , valued at us $ 30 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty million dollars ) in my branch . upon maturity , i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address in america and britain but got no reply . after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers , the chinese solid minerals corporation that mr . robert rice died alongside his wife , from an airplane crash . the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate . if you are familiar with private banking affairs , those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity , but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes . in his bio - data form , he listed no next of kin . in the field of private banking , opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence , accounts are rarely held under a name ; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; mr . robert rice died interstate . in line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away , we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate . this investigation has for the past months been unfruitful . we have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem . this sum of us $ 30 , 000 , 000 . 00 has since been sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one will ever come forward to claim it . according to the laws of republic of china , at the expiration of 5 ( five ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the chinese government if nobody applies to claim the funds . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose . there is us $ 30 , 000 , 000 . 00 deposited in my bank , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless evidence of relationship with the deceased , which i shall provide you with , is presented . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as bank of china is concerned , the bank ' s management has no single idea of what ' s the history or nature of the deposit . they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward . this is the situation . this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man ' s family ; they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to mr . robert rice so that the fruits of this old man ' s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials . acting in this capacity really is simple , all you have to do is provide your full names and address so that an attorney here can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin . we shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the necessary authentication , approval and a letter of probate / administration in your favour for the transfer to be done . a bank account in any part of the world that you then provide me with will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary / next of kin . the money will be paid into your account for us to share 80 / 20 . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by , for once i find myself in total control of my destiny . this is my chance and i wont let it pass me by . i ask that you do not destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family with new opportunities . there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank . there is no risk whatsoever as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantee the successful execution of this transaction . if you are interested in this lucrative role , i urge you to indicate to that effect . upon your response , if favourable , i shall then provide you with more details and relevant information that will help you get full understanding of the transaction . i will appreciate it if you send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easier communication . if you find yourself able to work with me , contact me through my confidential email address bankerchu _ sengchen @ yahoo . com . cn . if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels ; i will deny knowing you and about this project . i repeat , i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account . contact me only through the numbers i will provide for you and also through my confidential email address bankerchu _ sengchen @ yahoo . com . cn . my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy . please observe this instruction religiously . please , again , note i am a family man , i have a wife and children . i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences may be , but i know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold . this is the one truth i have learned from my private banking clients . do not betray my confidence . if we can be of one accord , we should plan a meeting , soon . in closing , please observe utmost confidentiality , and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country . upon receiving your reply , i will then furnish you with a more comprehensive detail of this transaction and what is required of you . awaiting your urgent reply via my confidential email addresss bankerchu _ sengchen @ yahoo . com . cn yours sincerely , mr . chu sengchen ce message a été composé avec le module webmail des services phpnuke - http : / / www . phpnukefrance . org",,,,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",3

"while you bait is at work ! joke of the day the american dairy association was so successful with its "" got milk ? "" campaign , that it was decided to extend the ads to mexico . unfortunately , the spanish translation was "" are you lactating ? "" electrolux , a scandinavian vacuum manufacturer , used this ad in the u . s . : "" nothing sucks like an electrolux . "" colgate introduced a toothpaste called "" cue "" in france , but it turned out to be the same name as a well - known porno magazine . when braniff translated a slogan touting its upholstery , "" fly in leather , "" it came out in spanish as "" fly naked . "" coors put its slogan , "" turn it loose , "" into spanish , where it was read as "" suffer from diarrhea . "" chicken magnate frank perdue ' s line , "" it takes a tough man to make a tender chicken , "" sounds much more interesting in spanish : "" it takes a sexually stimulated man to make a chicken affectionate . "" bacardi concocted a fruity drink with the name "" pavian "" to suggest french chic . . . but "" pavian "" means "" baboon "" in german . a hair products company , clairol , introduced the "" mist stick "" , a curling iron , into germany only to find out that mist is slang for manure . not too many people had use for the manure stick . when kentucky fried chicken entered the chinese market , to their horror they discovered that their slogan "" finger lickin ' good "" came out as "" eat your fingers off "" when vicks first introduce its cough drops on the german market , they were chagrined to learn that the german pronunciation of "" v "" is f - which in german is the guttural equivalent of "" sexual penetration . "" parker pens translated the slogan for its ink , "" avoid embarrassment - use quink "" into spanish as "" evite embarazos - use quink "" . . . which also means , "" avoid pregnancy - use quink . "" when pepsi started marketing its products in china a few years back , they translated their slogan , "" pepsi brings you back to life "" pretty literally . the slogan in chinese really meant , "" pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave . "" in italy , a campaign for "" schweppes tonic water "" translated the name into the much less thirst quenching "" schweppes toilet water . "" chinese translation proved difficult for coke , which took two tries to get it right . they first tried ke - kou - ke - la because when pronounced it sounded roughly like coca - cola . it wasn ' t until after thousands of signs had been printed that they discovered that the phrase means "" bite the wax tadpole "" or "" female horse stuffed with wax , "" depending on the dialect . second time around things worked out much better . after researching 40 , 000 chinese characters , coke came up with "" ko - kou - ko - le "" which translates roughly to the much more appropriate "" happiness in the mouth . "" not to be outdone , puffs tissues tried later to introduce its product , only to learn that "" puff "" in german is a colloquial term for a whorehouse . the english weren ' t too fond of the name either , as it ' s a highly derogatory term for a non - heterosexual . the chevy nova never sold well in spanish speaking countries . "" no va "" means "" it doesn ' t go "" in spanish . ford introduced the pinto in brazil . after watching sales go nowhere , the company learned that "" pinto "" is brazilian slang for "" tiny male genitals . "" ford pried the nameplates off all of the cars and substituted them with "" corcel "" which means horse . when gerber first started selling baby food in africa , they used the same packaging as here in the usa - with the cute baby on the label . later they found out that in africa companies routinely put pictures on the label of what ' s inside since most people can ' t read . in the french part of canada , hunt - wesson introduced its "" big john "" products as "" gros jos .

"next of kin [ business ] goodday , i am frenkel heydorn , staff of smith came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of thirty million united states dollars , which he wished to have us turn over ( invest ) on his behalf . i was the officer assigned to his case , i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de - facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector , especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank . we met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed . i encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings . the favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments . based on my advice , we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation , the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over ten million united states dollars , this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments . in mid 2001 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the united kingdom . he directed that i liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm . i informed him that smith & williamson would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process , the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 . i contacted my affiliate and made the funds available to the security firm . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited with the security firm . the security firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash . this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well - connected organizations . in line with instructions , the money was deposited with the security firm . the deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 25 th february 2003 . in june last year , we got a call from the security firm informing us that the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned , given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit at the security firm , and i could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his deposit . i made futile efforts to locate the deceased . i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of smith depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; the deceased died without a testate . in line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away , we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate . this investigation has for the past months been unfruitful . we have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem . it is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased . my official capacity dictates that i am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation . what this means , you being the last batch of names we have considered , is that our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member . this leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit . according to practice , the security firm will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to smith & williamson , failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to smith & williamson . this will result in the money entering the smith & williamson accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division . this will not happen if i have my way . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose . there is thirty million dollars deposited in a security firm , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as smith they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal ; you share the same surname with our late client ; i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the security firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . but on the other hand , you with the same very name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with right to claim . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you within a few days . i will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased i will then officially communicate with the security firm and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . the alternative would be for us to have the security firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder . this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the security company . we can fine - tune this based on our interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by , for once i find myself in total control of my destiny . these chances wont pass me by . i ask that you do not destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities . there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank . i am the only one who knows of this situation , good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life . lets share the blessing . if you find yourself able to work with me , contact me through this email account if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels ; i will deny knowing you and about this project . i repeat , i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account . contact me only through the numbers i will provide for you and also through this email address . i do not want any direct link between you and me . my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy . please observe this instruction religiously . please , again , note i am a family man , i have a wife and children . i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences , but i know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold . this is the one truth i have learned from my private banking clients . do not betray my confidence . i await your response . frenkel heydorn . mail sent from webmail service at php - nuke powered site fanghaowen . com - http : / / fanghaowen . com",,,,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",3

"telecom consolidation begins to accelerate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . hrlb vol . 6 , issue 243 - august 2002 the wall street bulletin your first source for news from the street symbol : igtt shares outstanding : 373 , 400 , 0000 float ( est . ) : 52 , 560 , 000 short - term target : $ 3 . 75 52 week high / low : $ 1 . 10 / 0 . 02 rating : strong buy our last pick symphony telecom ( otcbb : sypy ) went up 100 % in just one week ! ! ! indiginet identifies acquisition targets with combined revenues of $ 35 million . . . telecom consolidation begins to accelerate the wall street bulletin believes that the recent investment of capital into level 3 , lead by warren buffett , is further proof of the continued validity of the telecommunication market when looked at from the perspective of the small to mid - sized enterprises . after the boom and bust comes the revival . for some carriers drowning in debt , such as global crossing and worldcom , the future may be dim . but for those survivors of the industry that have managed to remain on their feet , other companies ' problems mean opportunity . every major industry in the history of the united states has experienced a similar transformation , from the railroads in the late 1800 s to the automakers in the mid - 1900 s to the dot - coms at the end of the 20 th century , says robert saunders , director of the eastern management group market research firm . christopher dean , cto of oss company eftia , says we are seeing all the people that are the survivors . there ' s all this pent - up money and for the surviving carriers out there , they can get what used to cost a few billion for a few millions . read the full story from telecommunications magazine - see the link at the end of this newsletter . as we write this report , our new recommendation indiginet , inc . ( otcbb : igtt ) has only been trading on the otc bulletin board since late may of 2002 . as indiginet , inc . continues to implement its business plan , we believe this company will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the telecom sector . this could be our strongest recommendation of the year . we are giving igtt our highest rating of strong buy / aggressive growth . ground floor opportunity / tremendous growth potential we believe igtt will perform equally to , if not greater than its competition . a similar telecommunications company , talk america holdings ( nasdaq : talk ) , share price began to explode in april of this year moving from just over $ 0 . 40 / share to over $ 4 . 00 / share in late june . talk america holdings previously had a market cap of only $ 24 . 51 million , but today has a market cap of $ 267 million . igtt curently has a market cap of $ 22 . 42 million . using the talk model for potential growth , igtt could very well be trading in the . 60 range in only a few months , with a market cap in excess of $ 250 million . this would be an increase of 1000 % . so you see why igtt has such great potential and the time is right for investors to get in on the ground floor . the indignet strategy indiginet , inc . is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid - sized enterprises ( smes ) with an integrated communication solution . indiginet is a prestigious diamond level partner of avaya , as well as a reseller for cisco and compaq . the company will offer data , local , long distance and wireless services to smes over third party networks enabling the company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building a communication network . the companys strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller , single market communication companies and attractively priced internet service providers ( isps ) . the company recently completed its acquisitions of fox telecommunications and wbconnect . indiginet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance profitability . smes account for $ 120 billion in commercial telephony , data services and technology spending , or 33 % of the countrys total market , and this spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years . source : morgan stanley dean witter . the igtt web site : www . indiginet . com the it market based on recent studies , the countrys 7 . 4 million smes currently lag significantly in the utilization of it and data communications , including internet access , web services , business software and e - commerce . worldwide it spending increased to $ 981 billion us for the year , an overall increase of 3 . 7 percent over 2001 , according to a study released 7 / 24 / 2002 by market researcher idc . it spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights , growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $ 1 trillion mark for the first time . in idc ' s revised forecasts for it spending in 2002 and 2003 , it spending in the us is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $ 436 billion , with further growth of 9 percent in 2003 . western europe can expect growth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003 . though japan will experience flat growth levels this year , by next year growth in the market will return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in china , india , korea , russia , the philippines , south africa and poland . source : idc particulars the wall street bulletin is putting igtt on our strong buy / aggressive growth recommendation list for the following reasons : 1 . the company ' s strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller , single - market communication companies and attractively priced internet service providers ( isps ) . the company will sell its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all types of communication services - local , long distance , wireless , and data . 2 . the company is currently serving many customers in the denver / front range communities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing campus network . the company ' s customers include united states olympic committee ( usoc ) , university of denver , and colorado state university . 3 . the company has identified approximately $ 35 , 000 , 000 in revenues to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer bases . each of the targeted companies are within the company ' s footprint and will , subject to purchase completion , increase the company ' s embedded customer base . investment consideration indiginet inc recently filed its 10 qsb , for the three months ended march 31 , 2002 . igtt reported revenues of $ 339 , 694 in ql 2002 vs . revenues of $ 0 in ql 2001 . at this current growth rate , revenues should grow above $ 1 . 3 million for their first year of production with no increases in acquisitions . as more and more large corporations come under government scrutiny , investors will turn to small to mid -

"california 6 / 13 executive summary - cpuc rules that socal must pay 15 % of debt to qfs ( approximately $ 50 million ) - ruling heightens likelihood of voluntary bankruptcy filing by socal - voluntary filing further heightened by successful ring - fencing by eix parent - bankruptcy judge firm in support for qfs report 1 . socal loses cpuc ruling , but retains appeal option as you may have seen , bloomberg reported that the cpuc voted 5 - 0 to force socal to make 15 % of its payments owed to alternative energy producers in california . cpuc rules allow 30 days to appeal its rulings , leaving a window open for socal to buy more time . 2 . voluntary filing in ? with regard to a socal bankruptcy filing , the key now is how socal ' s board feels about progress rather than deadlines with creditors . in other words , sources believe that a voluntary filing is more likely than an involuntary filing . a continuing lack of progress on a bailout and an increase in the number of liens filed against socal is more likely to make the socal board want to file for bankrutpcy voluntarily . the recent ring - fencing by edison international reflects their need to pay off cross - default risk and to cut ties in their bank facility between the parent company and lines of credit helds by socal . in and of outself , it does not necessarily signal an imminent filing . 3 . involuntary out ? sources indicate that the unsecured financial creditors are not considering a filing against socal . this is because the financial creditors believe that they would still be worse off in bankruptcy . sources report that in creditor discussions , there has not been talk of the debt holders not being paid . "" people have talked about screwing the generators and everyone else , but not the debt holders , "" a source commented . the qfs are unlikely to file against socal because they have fairly good contracts in place . also , they receive high capacity fees in the summer ( these fees vary seasonally and are distinct from generating fees ) . these capacity fees are calculated on a rolling , 4 - year basis and will be re - calculated next year . the qfs want this summer included in the recalculation , incentivizing them to keep their contracts in place . 4 . montali supporting qfs judge montali , by his recent rulings , is sending a signal that he is concerned for the qfs and is sensitive to their hardships . he is trying to help them through his rulings . for example , as long as qfs remain on line , those who petition can receive additional payments from pg & e . over a 4 - month period , these payments equal 20 % of the qfs ' pre - petition claims . this provides the qfs incentive to remain connected to pg & e . 5 . ge looking to restructure generating capacity financing general electric is reportedly "" deeply concerned "" about the stability of financing generating capacity in the us .

"urgent contact from the desk of : dr tom eke . e - mail : dr _ tomeke @ spinfinder . com lagos - nigeria . attn : request for urgent business relationship . it is with my profound dignity that i write you this very important and highly confidential letter . first , i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction . this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and "" top secret "" . though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried , considering the fact that we have not met each other before , but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day . we have decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of this transaction , as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you , so we decided it is best using the e - mail , which is quicker and also to enable us meet up with the second quater payment for the year 2000 . however , let me start by introducing myself properly to you . i am dr . tom eke , a director general in the department of petroleum resources ( d . p . r ) and i presently head the contract award panel incharge of contract awards and payment approvals . i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence . i and my colleagues are top officials of the federal government contract award panel . our duties include evaluation , vetting , approval for payment of contract jobs done for the d . p . r e . t . c . in order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds . the source of this funds is as follows : in the second quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to review and award contracts to the tune of us $ 400 million us dollars to a group of five firms for the supply construction and installation of oil pipe lines in warri and port harcourt . during this process my colleagues and i decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately over - inflate the total contract sum from us $ 400 million to us $ 431 million united states dollars with the main intention of sharing the remaining sum of us $ 31 miilion amongst ourselves . the federal government of nigeria has since the second quater of year 2001 approved the sum of us $ 431 million for us as the contract sum , and the sum of us $ 400 million has also been paid to the foreign companies concerned as contract entitlements for the various contracts done , but since the companies are entiltled to us $ 400 million dollars only , we are now left with us $ 31 million dollars balance in the account which we intend to disburse amongst ourselves , but by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel , we cannot do this by ourselves , as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil service laws ) from opening and / or operating foreign accounts in our names while still in government service , making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our names right now . i have therefore , been delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of us $ 31 million . hence we are writing you this letter . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf , you or your company will retain 20 % of the total amount ( us $ 31 million ) , while 70 % will be for us ( officials ) and the remaining 10 % will be used in offsetting all debts / expenses and taxes incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer . needless to say , the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in return we demand your complete honesty and trust . you must however note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below ; a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your custody , or any form of blackmail . d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from the total amount . please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and risk free and we hope to conclude this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary requirements from you . we are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your total confidentiality in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with us . transactions like this have been successfully carried out in the past by most government executives . here in my country there is great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant and the order of the day , thus explaining why you might have heard stories of how money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because everyone is making desperate attempts to secure his or her future , so that when we retire from active service we donot languish in poverty . i will explain more to you when i have heard from you . please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above e - mail address . i will bring you into the complete picture of this pending business transaction when i have heard from you and also receive your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me fax to you all necessary information you need to know about our pending business transaction . i will also send to you my private telephone and fax numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent response will be highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds under the second quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless . yours faithfully , dr . tom eke . n . b . please be informed that this business transaction is 100 % legal and completely free from drug money or money laundering . this is a complete legitimate business transaction . - -",,,,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",3

"re : hiring practices for summer interns charlene , thanks for the email . i have talked with sally several times on this last couple of days and i understand that ou has a different recruiting schedule then other schools . enron is on campus for recruiting in the near future and i have asked sally to tag on some interviews for summer interns while on that trip . i believe that she has been able to schedule this so i believe that from an ou perspective it may be a mute point now . doing that should be able to maintain the momentum that we have developed at ou and all the work lexi has done . by the way , the recruiting trip a couple of weeks ago was very successful . if you have any other questions or comments please let me know . mike charlene jackson @ enron 10 / 05 / 2000 06 : 34 am to : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect cc : celeste roberts / hou / ect @ ect , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron , mike mcconnell / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : hiring practices for summer interns sally , thanks for the e - mail regarding summer interns . i apologize that lexi and shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking . i wish that you had contacted either celeste or me to indicate that you were having difficulty . i have personally assured you on several occasions that i was available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any member of my staff was not responsive . that being said please allow me to explain the recruiting strategy since i was instrumental in helping to set it . you are absolutely correct . it is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge . as you are aware , over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm ( brecker & merryman ) who has assisted us in a number of different market research projects . however , in my opinion , this issue is not one that required much research . i have been involved in recruiting in some way , shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10 years . most major organizations , with the exception of the accounting firms , begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring . there are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date , particularly in the mba programs . for example , harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until january . as indicated , the firms that generally recruit in the fall are the accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for "" spring "" internships . the recruiting strategy at enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns . presentations were made in january however , because lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently . as you are aware , in most instances , the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early august . if you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts . i hope this has been helpful . i can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager . again , i offer that i am available and willing to work with you if you are having difficulty with members of the program staff . please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether i can be of any additional assistance . charlene",,,,"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]",1
